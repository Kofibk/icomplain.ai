**Subject: Formal Complaint - Undisclosed Commission on Motor Finance Agreement**
**Account/Agreement Reference: [INSERT YOUR AGREEMENT NUMBER]**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to make a formal complaint about a Personal Contract Purchase (PCP) agreement I entered into in June 2019, which was arranged through Arnold Clark Birmingham for the purchase of a BMW 3 Series. The total amount financed was approximately £18,000.

**Background**

At the time of arranging this finance, I was not informed that the dealer would receive commission from Black Horse in connection with my agreement. I was told by the salesman that this was the best rate available and that there were no other options. I now understand that this was not the case.

**Grounds for Complaint**

I believe I was mis-sold this finance agreement for the following reasons:

1. **Failure to disclose commission**: I was not told that Arnold Clark would receive commission from Black Horse. Under CONC 4.5.3R of the FCA Handbook, brokers are required to disclose the existence and nature of any commission arrangements. This did not happen.

2. **Discretionary Commission Arrangement (DCA)**: I understand that prior to January 2021, many motor finance agreements operated under discretionary commission arrangements, where dealers could increase the interest rate charged to customers in order to earn higher commission. If my agreement included such an arrangement, I was given no information about this.

3. **Conflict of interest**: The dealer had a financial incentive to place me on a higher interest rate rather than find me the most suitable or competitive deal. This represents a clear conflict of interest that was not disclosed to me.

4. **No alternative rates offered**: I was presented with only one finance option and was not told that different interest rates might be available, or that the rate I was offered may have been influenced by the commission payable to the dealer.

The Court of Appeal's judgment in Johnson v FirstRand Bank Ltd [2024] has confirmed that motor dealers owe fiduciary duties to customers when arranging finance, and that secret commission arrangements are unlawful. The FCA has also announced a redress scheme covering discretionary commission arrangements, contractual ties, and unfairly high commission.

**What I am Seeking**

I request that you:

1. Confirm whether my agreement included a discretionary commission arrangement or any other form of commission payable to the dealer
2. Provide full details of any commission paid to Arnold Clark in connection with my agreement
3. Refund any commission paid, plus compensatory interest at 8% per annum from the date of payment
4. Refund any additional interest I paid as a result of the commission arrangement
5. Provide compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused

**Next Steps**

I expect your final response within 8 weeks of the date of this letter. If I do not receive a satisfactory response within this timeframe, or if you reject my complaint, I will refer this matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service.

I look forward to your response.

Yours faithfully,

**Subject: Formal Complaint - Irresponsible Lending and Unaffordable Credit**
**Account Number: [INSERT YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER]**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to make a formal complaint about the credit card account I held with Barclaycard, which was opened in March 2018. I believe Barclaycard failed to carry out proper affordability assessments and lent to me irresponsibly.

**Background**

When I opened this account in March 2018, my monthly income was approximately £1,600. The initial credit limit was £2,000. Over the following period, my credit limit was repeatedly increased - without my request - until it reached £12,000.

At the time these increases were applied, I already had significant other debts and was struggling financially. The credit limit increases were applied automatically without Barclaycard asking me about my circumstances or checking whether I could afford additional credit.

**Why this lending was unaffordable**

Throughout the time I held this account:

- I could not afford the minimum payments and frequently struggled to meet them
- I was using the card for essential spending such as food and household bills because I had no other money available
- I was only making minimum payments for extended periods, sometimes years at a time
- The balance continued to grow due to interest charges despite my payments
- I had multiple other debts which should have been visible on my credit file

This situation caused me significant financial hardship, stress, and anxiety over a period of more than two years. The account is now in default.

**Regulatory Requirements**

Under CONC 5.2.1R of the FCA Handbook, lenders must undertake a reasonable assessment of creditworthiness before entering into a credit agreement or significantly increasing the credit limit. This assessment must consider:

- The potential for the credit commitment to adversely impact the customer's financial situation
- The customer's ability to make repayments as they fall due over the life of the agreement

Under CONC 5.2.2G, the extent and scope of the assessment should be dependent on factors including the customer's existing debt levels and previous repayment history.

I believe Barclaycard failed to meet these requirements. A reasonable assessment would have shown that:

1. My income was insufficient to service the credit limits provided
2. I had existing debts that should have been apparent from credit reference data
3. My payment patterns showed signs of financial difficulty (persistent minimum payments, use for essential spending)

**What I am Seeking**

I request that Barclaycard:

1. Refund all interest, fees, and charges applied to this account from the point at which lending became irresponsible
2. Remove any adverse credit file information relating to this account
3. Write off any outstanding balance that relates to irresponsible lending
4. Provide compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused

**Next Steps**

I require your final response within 8 weeks of the date of this letter. If I do not receive a satisfactory response, or if you reject my complaint, I will refer this matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service.

Yours faithfully,

**Subject: Formal Complaint - Refusal to Reimburse APP Scam Losses**
**Account Number: [INSERT YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER]**
**Fraud Reference: [INSERT ANY REFERENCE PROVIDED]**
**Action Fraud Reference: [INSERT YOUR ACTION FRAUD REFERENCE]**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to make a formal complaint regarding your refusal to reimburse me for losses I suffered as a result of an Authorised Push Payment (APP) scam on 15 August 2024. The total amount lost was £4,500.

**What Happened**

On 15 August 2024, I received a telephone call from someone claiming to be from HSBC's fraud team. The caller:

- Knew my full name and address
- Knew the last four digits of my debit card
- Told me that fraudulent activity had been detected on my account
- Said my money was at risk and needed to be moved to a "safe account" immediately
- Created a sense of urgency and panic

Believing this to be a genuine call from my bank, I followed the caller's instructions and transferred £4,500 to the account number they provided. I only realised this was a scam when I called HSBC directly afterwards and was told no such call had been made.

I reported this fraud to HSBC on.the same day (15 August 2024) and also reported it to Action Fraud.

**Your Response**

HSBC has refused to reimburse me, stating that I authorised the payment and should have been more careful. You indicated that warnings were displayed during the transfer which I proceeded past.

**Why I Believe HSBC Should Reimburse Me**

I do not accept that HSBC has treated me fairly. I would make the following points:

1. **Mandatory Reimbursement Requirement**: From 7 October 2024, the Payment Systems Regulator's mandatory reimbursement rules came into force. While my fraud occurred shortly before this date, the Contingent Reimbursement Model (CRM) Code was in operation, which HSBC signed up to. The Code requires signatory banks to reimburse blameless victims of APP scams.

2. **Sophisticated Scam**: This was a highly sophisticated impersonation scam. The fraudsters had access to my personal information, which made their approach extremely convincing. The FCA and PSR have repeatedly acknowledged that scams of this nature are increasingly sophisticated and that victims should not be blamed.

3. **Vulnerability**: I was placed under significant pressure and made to believe my money was at immediate risk. In this state, it is understandable that I may not have fully absorbed any warning messages. Generic warnings are often insufficient to protect customers from targeted impersonation scams.

4. **Bank's Duties**: HSBC has obligations under the CRM Code to detect and prevent APP scams, including through effective warnings and transaction monitoring. I question whether HSBC's systems and warnings are truly effective if they failed to prevent this payment.

**What I am Seeking**

I request that HSBC:

1. Reimburse the full £4,500 I lost to this scam
2. Pay compensatory interest at 8% per annum from 15 August 2024
3. Provide compensation for the significant distress and inconvenience I have suffered

**Next Steps**

I require your final response within 8 weeks of the date of this letter. If I do not receive a satisfactory response, or if my complaint is rejected, I will refer this matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service.

Yours faithfully,

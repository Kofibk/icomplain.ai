# Solicitor Brief: Template Review for iComplain

## About iComplain

iComplain is a document preparation tool that helps UK consumers generate complaint letters for financial services issues. We are NOT a claims management company - we provide templates and tools for people to submit their own complaints directly to lenders and the Financial Ombudsman Service.

**Key distinction**: We generate documents. We don't provide advice, don't act on behalf of customers, and don't take any success fees.

## What We Need

A **one-time review** of our complaint letter templates to ensure they are:
1. Legally accurate in their references
2. Using correct regulatory citations
3. Professionally formatted
4. Following best practices for FOS submissions
5. Not inadvertently providing "advice" or making claims we cannot make

## Templates to Review

### 1. PCP/Motor Finance Commission Complaint
- References: CONC 4.5.3R, Consumer Credit Act 1974, fiduciary duty
- Key case law: Johnson v FirstRand Bank Ltd (October 2024)
- Typical claims: undisclosed commission, discretionary commission arrangements

### 2. Section 75 Consumer Credit Act Claim
- References: Section 75 CCA 1974, joint and several liability
- £100-£30,000 threshold
- Breach of contract / misrepresentation grounds

### 3. Unaffordable Lending Complaint
- References: CONC 5 (responsible lending), creditworthiness assessment
- Sustainable repayment principles
- Remedies: interest refund, adverse credit data removal

### 4. Holiday Park / Timeshare Complaint
- References: Consumer Rights Act 2015, CPR 2008
- Pressure sales, misrepresentation, unfair terms

## Scope of Work

1. **Review each template** (~4 templates, ~2-3 pages each)
2. **Check legal accuracy** of citations, regulation references, and case law
3. **Flag any issues** where language could be construed as "advice"
4. **Suggest improvements** for clarity and effectiveness
5. **Provide brief written notes** on each template

## NOT in Scope

- Ongoing retainer or advisory relationship
- Representation of any consumers
- Changes to our business model
- FCA regulatory advice (we operate outside FCA regulation)

## Estimated Time

- 4-6 hours total
- Fixed fee preferred (suggest £400-600)

## Ideal Solicitor Profile

- Consumer credit / financial services experience
- Familiarity with FOS complaint process
- Understanding of PCP claims / commission disclosure issues
- Comfortable with one-off project work

## Timeline

- Templates provided: Immediately upon engagement
- Review completed: Within 7-10 days
- Format: Written notes/markup on each template

Subject: Template Review Project - Consumer Complaint Letters

Hi [Name],

I'm looking for a solicitor to review complaint letter templates for a document preparation tool. This is a one-off project (4-6 hours) reviewing 4 templates covering PCP claims, Section 75, unaffordable lending, and holiday park complaints.

The tool generates documents for consumers to submit themselves - we don't provide advice or act on their behalf.

I need someone to check:
- Legal accuracy of regulatory citations
- Correct case law references  
- Professional formatting
- That language doesn't inadvertently constitute "advice"

Fixed fee: £400-600
Timeline: 7-10 days

Would you be interested? Happy to share the templates and discuss further.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

## Next Steps

1. Post on PeoplePerHour / Bark
2. Message 5-10 solicitors on LinkedIn
3. Contact junior solicitors at consumer finance firms
4. Select based on: experience, availability, fixed fee willingness
5. Share templates, agree scope, pay deposit
6. Receive review, implement changes
